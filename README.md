This is a Worldwide Coin-Info app. Chakra UI has been used in this project which is responsible for the attractive UI.
Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.

In this project, an api from coingecko website has been fetched in a React Hook name UseEffect. and I have only mentioned the crucial info for every coin.

let's understand the project step by step :-

At the beginning, you see a beautiful home page with a nav bar having three routes option: Home, Exchange, Coins.

then if you click on Exchange option, then an another page component will render which display all the coin type by their Ranks. As you can see through an img given below:

After that, if you click on coin option, then an another page component will render which display all the coins with their current price, symbol, img. On the same page, you can radio button options to set currency. and when you click on one of any radio button, then useeffect hook will re-render this page and the price will have resettled accordingly.


then, if you want some info about each and every coin, then simple click on any coin. After click, a page will render with for that particular coin id which will display the graph report, and all the important data will be rendered.
